A self-contained, browser-based tool for real-time log file analysis. It uses modern browser APIs to "tail" local files, parsing new lines as they are written and updating a metrics dashboard in real-time. The entire application is a single HTML file with no dependencies, no build step, and no server-side components. All processing is done client-side.

### Core Features

* **Live File Tailing**: Monitors a local file for changes, reading new data as it's appended. It also gracefully handles log rotation (when a file is cleared and starts over).
* **Regex-Based Parsing**: Extracts structured data from unstructured log lines using configurable regular expressions. It's pre-configured for Anarchy Online chat logs but can be adapted.
* **Dynamic UI**: Presents data in a filterable, sortable table and a dashboard for tracking key performance indicators (like XP/hour).
* **Client-Side Operation**: No data ever leaves your machine. All file reading and processing happens locally in the browser.
* **Data Export**: Session data can be exported to CSV for external analysis or as a JSON snapshot to save the current state.

* **Rarity Filter**: Use this to hide common clutter. If you only want to see valuable or interesting items, set this to "Uncommon+" or "Rare+" to hide all the junk.

* **Min Events**: This is great for cleaning up the view. If you only want to see items that have dropped at least 5 times, set this to "5" to hide anything that has appeared less frequently.

* **View Buttons (All, Kept, Discarded, Discarded-only)**: These are powerful one-click filters.
    * Click **"Kept"** to see everything you've actually picked up.
    * Click **"Discarded"** to see a list of everything you've thrown away.
    * Click **"Discarded-only"** to answer the question, "What am I *always* throwing away and never keeping?"

#### Key Settings Explained

* **Base % on all events**: When checked, the `%` column is calculated from the grand total of everything seen. If unchecked, it's calculated only from the items you've `Kept`. This helps you see an item's drop rate relative to only the things you consider valuable.

### How It Works

The tool primarily relies on the **File System Access API**, which is the recommended mode for Chromium-based browsers.

When you attach a file, the application gets a special "handle" that allows it to securely interact with the file without having full access to your hard drive. A timer runs every second or so to check the file's properties.
* If the file's size has grown, the tool knows new lines have been added. It reads only the new part, from where it last left off to the new end of the file.

For browsers that don't support this modern API, the tool uses a fallback method. This involves a standard file input. Because this older method doesn't allow for reading just a small piece of a file, the tool has to quickly re-read the entire file on every check to see what's new. This is less efficient but ensures the tool still works.

* **Renormalize % to visible**: This is a powerful analysis tool. When checked, it recalculates all percentages based *only on the items currently shown in the table*. For example, if you filter the table down to just two rare items, this setting will show you how they compare to each other (e.g., one might be 60% of the filtered view, the other 40%).

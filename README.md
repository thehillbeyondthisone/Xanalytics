# Xanalytics ðŸ“Š

A self-contained, browser-based tool for real-time log file analysis. It uses Chrome / Edge browser APIs to "tail" local files, parsing new lines as they are written and updating a metrics dashboard in real-time. The entire application is a single HTML file with no dependencies, no build step, and no server-side components.

### Core Features

* **Live File Tailing**: Monitors a local file for changes, reading new data as it's appended. It also gracefully handles log rotation (when a file is cleared and starts over).
* **Regex-Based Parsing**: Extracts structured data from unstructured log lines using configurable regular expressions. It's pre-configured for Anarchy Online chat logs but can be adapted.
* **Dynamic UI**: Presents data in a filterable, sortable table and a dashboard for tracking key performance indicators (like XP/hour).
* **Client-Side Operation**: No data ever leaves your machine. All file reading and processing happens locally in the browser.
* **Data Export**: Session data can be exported to CSV for external analysis or as a JSON snapshot to save the current state.

#### INSTRUCTIONS

* **Step 1: Create Log**: Open the "Friends" window, then right click your listed chat windows and create a new one (name it anything you like). Right click it and turn on logging; choosing "Show Log Window" will show the exact directory of the new log. This is the Log.txt you'll drop into Xanalytics in step 3.

* **Step 2: Subscribe to appropriate channels**: Open and right click your new chat window, and subscribe to the following channels:
*    -Vicinity Loot Messages
*    -Me got XP
*    -Me got SK

* **View Buttons**
    * Click **"Kept"** to see everything you've actually picked up.
    * Click **"Discarded"** to see a list of everything you've thrown away.

#### Key Settings Explained

* **Base % on all events**: When checked, the `%` column is calculated from the grand total of everything seen. If unchecked, it's calculated only from the items you've `Kept`. This helps you see an item's drop rate relative to only the things you consider valuable.

### Tracking Your XP Gain

The **XP Metrics** dashboard is designed to give you a live, at-a-glance view of your progress. It automatically detects different types of experience points from the log and calculates useful metrics based on that data.

#### Setting Goals and Tracking ETAs

The three goal cards (for XP, AXP, and SK) turn the tool into a powerful planning utility.

1.  **Enter Your Goal**: In the input box for each card, type the total amount of XP you need to reach your next level or goal.
2.  **Watch the Progress Bar**: The bar will fill up as you gain XP, showing you a quick visual of how far you have to go. The label next to it gives you the exact numbers (`You Have / You Need`).
3.  **Check the ETA**: The "ETA" (Estimated Time of Arrival) tells you approximately how much longer it will take to reach your goal. **This estimate is based on your short-term (last 10 minutes) gain rate**, making it a dynamic prediction of when you'll finish if you continue at your current pace.

#### Using the XP Feed and Filters

* **XP Feed**: The box at the very bottom of the panel is a live feed that shows every individual XP gain as it happens. This is useful for seeing the immediate results of your actions.
* **XP Filters**: On the left-side panel, you can check or uncheck the different XP types. Unchecking a type will exclude it from all calculations on the dashboardâ€”the totals, rates, ETAs, and the live feed will ignore it. This lets you focus only on the specific types of progress you care about at the moment.
